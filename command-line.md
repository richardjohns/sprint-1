Q1: Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
A1: Ah, well the command line is a way to interact with your computer purely by typing commands in so no using the mouse. For a lot of professionals it actually turns out to be a faster way to interact with a computer than by using a mouse than something like windows or macosx. Some basic stuff would be moving around and working with files and directories, and web developers use something in command line called Git to work in teams with their websites.

Q2: List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
A2:
1. mkdir: create a file folder to store other files or folders in.
2. pwd: command to ask the computer to show you which folder you're currently in
3. ls: command to ask the computer to show you the files or folders that are currently in the same folder that you're in.
4. touch: creates a file in the folder you're currently in (can specify after touch the name and type of file you want created)
5. cd: Command to move where you are to another folder within the file structure.
6. rm: Allows you to remove a file from the system.
7. cp: Allows you to move a file from one folder to another.
8. mv: Seems to imply move a file but in reality allows you to rename a file.
9. ZZ: (ie two capital z's) Breaks you out of a process if not going to plan ie you're stuck.
10. rm -r: Allows you to remove a folder (or directory) from the system.
